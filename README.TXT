QRcode generator in JAVA.

This is a QRcode generator made in JAVA. It takes the fields filled in the GUI and builds the QRcode with them. 
The code divides the "Quantidade" field by the "Divisor" and the result will be the total number of QRcodes printed.
The QRcodes are also arranged in a A4 page ready to print.
