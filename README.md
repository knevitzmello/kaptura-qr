# QRcode generator

This is a QRcode generator made in JAVA. It takes the fields filled in the GUI and builds the QRcode with them. 
The code divides the "Quantidade" field by the "Divisor" and the result will be the total number of QRcodes printed.
The QRcodes are also arranged in a A4 page ready to print. 

This code is meant to work with a specific Android App, but the code can be repurposed.
